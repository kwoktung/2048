# 2048 Game

A modern, responsive implementation of the classic 2048 puzzle game built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## 🎮 About

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. However, you can keep playing beyond 2048 to achieve higher scores!

## ✨ Features

- **Smooth Animations**: Fluid tile movements and merging animations
- **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback when tiles merge
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Keyboard Controls**: Intuitive arrow key navigation
- **Game State Management**: Automatic game over detection and restart functionality
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with React 19, TypeScript, and Vite

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd 2048
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Click the "Start" button to begin
2. **Move Tiles**: Use the arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →) to slide tiles in that direction
3. **Merge Tiles**: When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values
4. **Goal**: Reach the 2048 tile (or keep going for higher scores!)
5. **Game Over**: The game ends when no more moves are possible
6. **Restart**: Click "Restart" to begin a new game

### Game Rules

- All tiles slide in the direction of the arrow key pressed
- Tiles with the same number merge when they collide
- After each move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears in a random empty cell
- The game continues until no more moves are possible
